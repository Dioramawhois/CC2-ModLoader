# CC2 ModLoader

Choose the Carrier Command 2 mods you want to play. ModLoader combines their
files into one local mod, merges changes where possible, and starts the game
with that build selected.

**Windows x64 beta · 0.4.0 beta 13**

## Start here

1. Download **CC2ModLoader.exe** using the link above.
2. In Steam, right-click **Carrier Command 2 → Manage → Browse local files**.
   Put the downloaded EXE beside **carrier_command.exe**.
3. Close the game, then open **CC2ModLoader.exe**.
4. Tick the mods you want. Wait for **Ready** and read any warning.
5. Click **Launch game**. Your combined mod is already enabled.

Your game folder should look like this:

```text
Carrier Command 2/
  carrier_command.exe
  CC2ModLoader.exe
```

### 1. Choose your mods

Ticking a box checks, combines and applies that selection automatically.
Unticking a box rebuilds the result without that mod.

Use **Disable all** to clear mods and libraries together. ModLoader applies the
empty selection automatically; **Menu → Restore previous selection…** can undo
the change. If the game is open, keep ModLoader open until the game closes.
This action leaves downloaded mods and saves in place.

*Example workspace: two Workshop mods selected; two local demonstration mods left off.*

### 2. Put patches in the right order

Open **Load order** and drag a mod, or use **Alt+Up / Alt+Down**.
Changing the order rebuilds the combined files automatically.

By default, patches lower in the list take priority where changes overlap.
For example, put a compatibility patch after the mods it is meant to change.

### 3. Manage shared libraries

Some mods use a shared library such as **CC2X SDK**. The **Libraries** tab lists
these packages. Declared dependencies are included automatically when available;
you can also select a library here. The SDK supplies tools for mods; gameplay
features come from the separate mods you choose.

The app includes a reviewed CC2X SDK fallback and accepts official signed SDK
updates from Workshop. Compatible SDK updates no longer require replacing the
ModLoader executable. Supported older installations are upgraded with backup and
Undo. If a downloaded SDK version is unsupported, the warning identifies that
library separately from an incompatible loader already installed in the game.

### 4. Read warnings before launching

Two mods can edit the same file without changing the same parts. ModLoader tries
to keep those edits together. If a later patch replaces another mod's changes,
an orange warning names the mods and the file.

**Ready means the files are prepared. It does not guarantee that the mods work
together in the game.** Review **Menu → Problem details…**, change the order or
untick a mod if needed. **Menu → Later patches take priority** controls this policy.

![An orange warning identifies the two example patches with overlapping changes.](docs/images/04-overlap-warning.png)

*Conflict demonstration: the two “Example:” patches deliberately overlap.*

## Everyday use

- **Workshop and local mods:** subscribed Workshop items are found automatically.
  Windows custom mods are also read from `%APPDATA%\Carrier Command 2\mods` and
  the game's `mods` folder. New discoveries appear unchecked.
- **Mod updates:** selected mods are checked again when you open ModLoader and
  while it stays open. Changes wait until the game is closed before applying.
- **Large collections:** installed resources are hashed incrementally; unchecked
  mod contents are not all retained in memory. Beta 8 fixes the former startup
  `Input byte limit exceeded` failure. See [resource limits](docs/INSTALLATION.md#large-mods-and-resource-limits).
- **One result:** ModLoader maintains one generated `mods/CC2-MCE` package.
  Source mod files stay in place. The previous applied set is kept if a change
  is rejected; **Menu → Restore previous selection…** offers the recorded undo.
- **In the game:** the combined mod is selected before launch. Change the set
  in ModLoader with the game closed. The matching SDK's screen
  extension shows **CC2 ModLoader** and selected mod names on the main menu,
  and to gray out its **Mods** entry. See the
  [beta 7 exact-build menu verification](docs/verification/main-menu-v4.md) for
  that binary's acceptance status and scope. Beta 9 changes the pinned runtime;
  historical menu evidence does not certify its exact new binary pair.
- **Your language:** the UI follows the system language. Choose another in
  **Menu → Language**; 14 offline languages are included.

## Before you start

This is a **Windows beta**. Some mod combinations are incompatible. Native
SDK/plugins require supported game/runtime versions; multiplayer, dedicated
servers and a packaged macOS app are not certified by this release.
[Compatibility and test scope](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) explains the limits.

The screenshots show the actual application in an isolated demonstration
workspace, not gameplay acceptance. [Screenshot details](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md).
